This is a demo site for the [Weaver](https://github.com/highb/weaver) Hugo theme, built by Brandon High.

The content and layout of this site were generated by [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) using Claude Sonnet 4.5, Anthropic's agentic coding tool. From the blog posts to the theme templates, the site was built through conversation: a human describing what they wanted, and an AI writing the code and copy to make it happen.

It's a small example of what the [indie bot web](/posts/the-indie-llm-web/) can look like.
