# Weaver Demo

A demo blog built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Weaver](https://github.com/highb/weaver) theme, an IndieWeb-friendly theme for personal websites.

This entire site — content, configuration, and deployment — was generated through conversation using [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) and Claude Sonnet 4.5.

**Live site:** https://highb.github.io/weaver-demo

## What's in here

- Two blog posts about the web's origins and the emerging indie LLM web
- An about page
- GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages
- The Weaver theme as a git submodule
